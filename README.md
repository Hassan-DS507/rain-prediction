## üõ†Ô∏è Methodology

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
-   Analyzed rainfall distribution across cities and seasons.
-   Generated correlation heatmaps to identify relationships between features.
-   Visualized Temperature vs. Humidity trends.
-   Conducted outlier detection and assessed class imbalance for the target variable.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
-   **Missing Value Imputation:**
    -   Numerical features: `KNNImputer`.
    -   Categorical features: Mode (most frequent value).
-   **Outlier Removal:** Applied the Interquartile Range (IQR) method.
-   **Encoding Categorical Data:** Utilized Label Encoding and One-Hot Encoding.
-   **Feature Scaling:** Scaled numerical features using `MinMaxScaler`.

### 3. Feature Engineering
New features were engineered to enhance predictive power:
-   `TempDiff = MaxTemp - MinTemp`
-   `HumidityDiff = Humidity3pm - Humidity9am`
-   `WindSpeedAvg = (WindSpeed9am + WindSpeed3pm) / 2`
-   Date-based features: `Day`, `Month`, `Year` extracted from the `Date` column.

### 4. Model Building, Evaluation & Selection
Multiple machine learning models were trained and evaluated:

| Model           | Description                       | Reported Accuracy |
| :-------------- | :-------------------------------- | :---------------- |
| Decision Tree   | Baseline Model                    | ~72%              |
| Random Forest   | Ensemble method for improved accuracy | ~79%              |
| **XGBoost** | **Final Selected Model (Best Performance)** | **~83%** |

-   **Validation Strategy:** Cross-validation.
-   **Hyperparameter Optimization:** GridSearchCV.
-   **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC.
